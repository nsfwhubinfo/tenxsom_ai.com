SUBJECT: URGENT: Persistent 522/523 Cloudflare Errors on Video Generation Endpoints - Business Critical

================================================================================

Dear UseAPI.net Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical infrastructure issue affecting our production video generation system. Our video generation endpoints have been returning persistent 522/523 Cloudflare errors for several months, completely blocking our business operations.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION:
- Email: goldensonproperties@gmail.com
- Bearer Token: user:1831-r8vA1WGayarXKuYwpT1PW
- Account Type: Premium (Veo2, LTX Turbo, Flux access)

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- ALL video generation endpoints return 522 Connection Timeout errors
- Assets endpoint works perfectly (confirming authentication is valid)
- Issue persists for several months
- Complete production pipeline blocked

AFFECTED ENDPOINTS:
❌ POST /v1/veo2/generate - 522 Timeout (20+ seconds)
❌ POST /v1/ltxstudio/create - 522 Timeout (20+ seconds)  
❌ GET /v1/accounts/credits - 522 Timeout (19+ seconds)
✅ GET /v1/ltxstudio/assets/ - 200 OK (1 second) - ONLY WORKING

MINIMAX CHATBOT CONSULTATION:
We consulted your MiniMax AI assistant twice and implemented ALL recommended fixes:
- ✅ Corrected payload parameters (removed invalid params)
- ✅ Fixed URL formats (removed trailing slashes from video endpoints)
- ✅ Updated headers and authentication
- ✅ Used correct API parameter names

MINIMAX FINAL ASSESSMENT: "Root Cause: Server-side infrastructure issues at UseAPI.net affecting video endpoints."

TECHNICAL EVIDENCE:
After implementing all MiniMax fixes, only 25% of endpoints work:
- Assets endpoint: 200 OK (authentication confirmed working)
- Video endpoints: Still returning 522 Cloudflare timeouts
- Error consistency: 100% failure rate on video generation

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Production System: Tenxsom AI Video Generation Platform
- Target Capacity: 96 videos/day (2,880 videos/month)
- Revenue Impact: $46,080/month potential blocked
- Current Status: Operating on Google AI Ultra failover (higher costs)

REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL TEAM:
This appears to be server-side infrastructure degradation specific to video generation endpoints. Please investigate:

1. Origin server connectivity for video generation endpoints
2. Cloudflare edge configuration differences between working/failing endpoints  
3. Infrastructure capacity or scaling issues affecting video workloads
4. Regional routing problems specific to video generation services

RECENT ERROR TIMESTAMPS:
- 2025-07-06 04:01:22 - LTX Turbo server error 522
- 2025-07-06 04:01:31 - LTX Turbo server error 523
- 2025-07-06 04:02:07 - LTX generation failed after 3 attempts
- 2025-07-06 04:00:30 - Veo2 generation failed after 3 attempts

SAMPLE CORRECTED REQUEST (LTX Studio):
POST https://api.useapi.net/v1/ltxstudio/create
Authorization: Bearer user:1831-r8vA1WGayarXKuYwpT1PW
Content-Type: application/json

}

RESPONSE: 522 Connection Timeout (20+ seconds)

We have exhausted all client-side fixes per your MiniMax recommendations. This requires your technical team's intervention to resolve the server infrastructure issues.

Please provide:
- Technical analysis of the video endpoint infrastructure status
- Estimated resolution timeline for production planning
- Any workarounds while infrastructure is restored

Additional documentation available upon request:
- Complete error logs with timestamps
- MiniMax chatbot conversation transcripts
- cURL test scripts and results
- Network diagnostic outputs

Thank you for your urgent attention to this critical matter.

P.S. We have implemented Google AI Ultra failover to maintain operations, but prefer to restore UseAPI.net for cost optimization and service redundancy.
