Channel idea: Level One Citizen - An animated series that follows two anthropomorphic animated characters that are similar to SpongeBob and Patrick in demeanor, who are the protagonist's in the video that glitch into different realities at the start of each episode(like Quantum Leap )and are ontologically adapted to level one civilization standards, albeit with average and below average intellect, they unwittingly solve level zero problems and arguments with common sense immutable logic in the end. The meat of the show in between features the exploration of the animation style that is generated by our production. The inspiration for this in abstract, comes from just scrolling through the main page of MidJourney and Sora.com. Treat the best of the user posts as storyboard templates and character packs. This, in and of itself, in most cases be enough to create a script for at least 2-5 minute production.
